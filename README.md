To achieve the task of collecting logs from Lambda functions (Node.js runtime), detecting errors, storing them in a DynamoDB table, and setting up an API to retrieve and notify errors using the Lambda Extension, follow these steps:

Setup AWS Resources:

Create an SNS Topic to send notifications (e.g., "LambdaErrorNotifications").
Create a DynamoDB table (e.g., "ErrorLogs") with appropriate attributes.
Deploy the Lambda Extension:

Clone the Lambda Extension sample repository from Amazon's GitHub.
Follow the instructions in the repository's README to deploy the Lambda Extension to your Lambda functions. This extension will capture and forward logs.
Create a Lambda Function to Process and Store Errors:

Create a new Lambda function (e.g., "ProcessLambdaErrors") using Node.js runtime.
Configure the Lambda function to trigger on the SNS Topic (LambdaErrorNotifications) for error notifications.
In the Lambda function, parse the incoming error notifications, extract required attributes (Function Name, Region, Account ID, Execution ID, Execution Time, Error Type, Error Message, Stack Trace), and store them in the DynamoDB table ("ErrorLogs").
Create an API Gateway:

Create a new API using Amazon API Gateway.
Create resource paths and methods to handle error log retrieval and filtering.
Set up request parameters for page size, sorting, account ID, and function name filtering.
Implement Lambda Function for API Integration:

Create a new Lambda function (e.g., "ErrorLogsAPI") using Node.js runtime.
Configure the Lambda function to integrate with the API Gateway.
Implement logic to retrieve error logs from the DynamoDB table based on query parameters (page size, sorting, account ID, function name).
Return the retrieved error logs as an API response.
Send SNS Notifications for Error Detection:

In your Lambda functions' code, handle errors and exceptions by logging detailed error messages and stack traces.
The Lambda Extension will forward these logs to CloudWatch.
Set up CloudWatch Log Metric Filters to detect error patterns based on log content.
When a specific error pattern is detected, configure a CloudWatch Alarm to send an SNS notification to the "LambdaErrorNotifications" topic.
Test the Solution:

Trigger Lambda functions with intentional errors to ensure logs are captured and processed correctly.
Test the API endpoints to retrieve error logs based on query parameters.
By following these steps, you will have a solution in place to collect logs from Lambda functions, detect errors, store them in DynamoDB, and provide an API to retrieve and notify about errors. The Lambda Extension will play a key role in capturing logs, while CloudWatch Log Metric Filters and Alarms will help in detecting errors for SNS notifications.
